## About me

# Hi, I'm Hector!

I am a dedicated junior full-stack developer with a passion for solving problems creatively. Over the past year, I have dedicated myself to mastering the core concepts of full-stack development, combining my knowledge of both front-end and back-end technologies to create seamless and efficient web applications. 

I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and collaborate with others in the tech community. I thrive in environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects. My goal is to leverage my skills in JavaScript and full-stack development to create innovative solutions that enhance user experiences. Outside of my technical pursuits, I am committed to lifelong learning and regularly engage with resources such as documentation, online forums, and industry articles to stay updated on the latest trends and best practices in web development. I am excited to connect with fellow developers, share insights, and explore potential collaborations in the tech space.
